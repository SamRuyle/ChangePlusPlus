Reflection: I had a lot of fun with this project. This was the first time I ever made a full stack 
project without anyone holding my hand, and it was very satisfying to watch my project come to life.
Some of the code and algorithms I wrote were a little bit sloppy, and I would love to go back and 
tweak and work on them some more. I also would love to go back and make the frontend prettier. 

I think this was a very cool project, especially for someone's first solo project. It was fun and
engaging, and all of the back and forth between the frontend and the backend was challenging yet 
rewarding. I feel as though I have the skills to complete any project I can dream up. 

I finished the exercise, but there were a couple of things I wish I had the time and the knowhow to fix. 
    a. My scramble algorithm - I wrote a long comment about my scramble algorithm. Its not perfect, and Its
    a little slow, but it works. 

    b. My frontend styling - I never could figure out how to have different styles for different pages 
    for my reused start button. I don't think it would have mattered though, as it would have been ugly,
    but it would've been nice to know how. 


INSTRUCTIONS

1. Make sure you have NPM and Node installed
    type in the commands 'npm -v' and 'node -v' on your command line to see if you have them installed
    If not, go to this link: nodejs.org/en/download 
    
2. Clone the github repository of this project to a local file on your computer, and then navigate to the file using the terminal, and 
run the command 'npm install'
    (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) 

3. Open two terminal windows, and change your directory on both windows using the 'cd' commands until your current directory is 
the directory with my project in it. 

On one window, type in the command 'cd frontend', and then 'npm start'. this will start up the frontend, and should open a 
new window on a browser for you. If not, you can go to http://localhost:3000 in the search bar of your browser

On the other window, type 'cd backend' and then 'node server.js' It should read 'Server is running on port 4000'

4. Have fun playing the game!
